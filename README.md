=============

Small version of a grails app accessing the flights schema from GemXD tutorial on pivhdsne. 

I'm creating the table on gemxd using the built in hibernate support.  Its not an exact match and I'll need to fix this before I can populate the data from the 'run loadTables.sql' script.  It only uses the "AIRLINE" table and I populate inside of conf/bootstrap.groovy.
